This Java class, MiniMaxID, implements the MiniMax algorithm with a time-limited search for the Othello game. The algorithm is designed for an Othello player represented by the PlayerID class. The goal is to find the best move for the player within a given time limit.

Features:
Algorithm: The MiniMax algorithm is employed to search for the best move in the Othello game tree.
Time Limit: The search is time-limited, ensuring that the algorithm returns a move within a specified time frame.
Heuristic Evaluation: The class uses a heuristic function (Heuristica) to evaluate the game state and determine the desirability of a move.
Transposition Table: The algorithm utilizes a transposition table (BaseDades) to store and retrieve previously computed heuristic values for board positions.
Zobrist Hashing: The Zobrist hashing technique is applied to efficiently represent the board state and compute its hash value.
Alpha-Beta Pruning: The algorithm uses alpha-beta pruning to enhance the efficiency of the search process.
